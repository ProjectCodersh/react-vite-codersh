By consolidating inventory, orders, and customer data in one location, Shopify makes it easy to manage retail and wholesale clients alongside your direct-to-consumer (DTC) customers. B2B features like custom pricing, volume-based discounts, and tailored customer experiences allow businesses to operate from a single platform while offering flexible billing options, including pricing in multiple currencies and custom price lists.",

This feature is particularly valuable for businesses expanding globally or serving diverse markets, making wholesale orders as seamless as DTC transactions.

                                        As businesses expand globally on Shopify, adapting to international markets is crucial. Going global enables merchants to access a broader customer base, increase transactions, and boost revenue. Recent data shows that 35% of Shopify traffic is international, emphasizing the need for a global ecommerce strategy. Additionally, 92% of these visitors prefer shopping in their local currency, with 33% likely to abandon purchases if prices are only in US dollars.

                                        Shopify Plus also offers a dedicated Wholesale Channel, enabling you to create a password-protected storefront for wholesale customers. This ensures retail clients can’t access B2B pricing, and product pricing adjusts automatically for wholesale buyers. You can also customize the domain for a branded B2B storefront. However, for advanced features or greater customization, Codersh Web Services can help enhance and expand your B2B operations.
